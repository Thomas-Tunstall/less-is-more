# LESS is more

Teach yourself the basics of LESS through simple coding exercises. Based on the node [workshopper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/workshopper) adventure format popularized by [NodeSchool](https://nodeschool.io).

This adventure is inspired by the [LESS language features documentation](http://lesscss.org/features/)

## Install Node.js

Make sure Node.js is installed on your computer.

Install it from [nodejs.org/download](http://nodejs.org/download)

### Install `less-is-more` with `npm`

Open your terminal and run this command:

```bash
npm install -g less-is-more
```

The `-g` or `--global` option installs this module globally so that you can run it as a command in your terminal.

#### Having issues with installation?

If you get an `EACCESS` error, the simplest way to fix this is to rerun the command, prefixed with sudo:

```bash
sudo npm install -g less-is-more
```

You can also fix the permissions so that you don't have to use `sudo`. Have a look at the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions).

## Run the workshop

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
less-is-more
```

You'll see the menu:
